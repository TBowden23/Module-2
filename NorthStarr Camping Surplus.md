<ins><b>Target Audience:</b></ins>
* My primary target audience is Men and Women in their early 20’s to mid 40’s, preferably married parents, interested in an outdoorsy lifestyle, from      camping, hunting, hiking, fishing, boating, backpacking.


<ins><b>Reasons for design choices:</b></ins>
* I chose to design my site the way I did to increase ease of use for my potential customers. A large header section including my logo I thought gives   the site a simple yet elegant aesthetic. I included a horizontal navigation bar to make sure the potential customers can find everything they need. I used large images and Inter font text to grab attention and put eyes where I needed them to be.
* The colors I chose to accent my site were Gold and Royal Blue. Since my site is NorthStarr I thought the gold would fit the Star theme nicely and add an air of Prestige and High Value. The Blue I included to add a bit of Friendliness and Trust as well as some Integrity.
* I will space out the header text over my photos to make sure they are visible and not clouded.
