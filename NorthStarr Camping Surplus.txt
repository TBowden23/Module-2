Reasons for design choices:
      * I chose to design my site the way I did to increase ease of use for my potential customers. A large header section including my logo I thought gives the site a simple yet elegant aesthetic. I included a horizontal navigation bar to make sure the potential customers can find everything they need. I used large images and Inter font text to grab attention and put eyes where I needed them to be.
      * The colors I chose to accent my site were Gold and Royal Blue. Since my site is NorthStarr I thought the gold would fit the Star theme nicely and add an air of Prestige and High Value. The Blue I included to add a bit of Friendliness and Trust as well as some Integrity.
      * I will space out the header text over my photos to make sure they are visible and not clouded.
